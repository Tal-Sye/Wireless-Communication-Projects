A user makes a call from a car moving away from a base station at v = 40
miles/hour.
Assume the following parameters for the transmitter and receiver:
	– power of the base station Pt = 30 Watts,
	– carrier frequency f = 1.4 GHz,
	– transmitter antenna gain Gt = 1,
	– receiver antenna gain Gr = 8,
	– minimum received power to maintain a call γ⊤ = −85 dBm, that means
	the call will be interrupted if received power goes below γ⊤,
	– the received power follows the Free Space Propagation Model from the
	base station to the reference distance d0 = 2 Km,
	– after distance d > d0, the path loss exponent n = 4, and no log-normal
	shadowing,
	– the user starts the call at d = 1 Km (t = 0 seconds) from the transmitter.
	and ends the call at d = 5 Km,
	– Pr denotes the received power the receiver,
	– t is the time spent after the call starts.

1. Plot path-loss (in dB) as a function of d (in Km). Find the distance
(in Km) in meters from the plot where the call will be interrupted.
2. Plot path-loss (in dB) as a function of t (minutes). Find the time
in minutes from the plot when the call will be interrupted.
