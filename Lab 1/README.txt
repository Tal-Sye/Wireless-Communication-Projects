1. Use MATLAB to generate a vector of 10 bits, where each bit is -1
with probability 0.45.
2. Use MATLAB to generate a ternary sequence (i.e. −1, 0, +1 sequence)
of length 10, where probability of −1 and that of +1 in the sequence
is 0.4. Note that your code will yield a vector of 10 ternary elements.
3. Use MATLAB to generate four (complex) vectors of length 128 such
that ||Sm||2 = SH
mSm = 1, where m = 1, 2, 3, 4 and SH
mSn = 0 for m ̸= n.
4. Use MATLAB to generate a random (complex) vector of length 128
such that ||S1||2 = 1 and then generate another (complex) vector of length 64
S2 such that ||S2||2 = 1 and SH1
S2 = 0. Note that every time your MATLAB
code will generate a different set of S1 and S2.
