1. Assume Ricean fading single path channel (between a pair of transmitting
and receiving antennas) with BPSK modulation where bits are derived
from an equally likely Â±1 sequence and the transmitter uses a deterministic
waveform for simplicity. Use MATLAB to plot BER under coherent detection
when the receiver is equipped with M = 1, 2, 3 and 4 antennas to exploit receive
diversity (use Selection Diversity, Maximal Ratio Combining and Equal Gain
Combining). Your figure will include plots from system simulation. Use SNR
(complex) from -5 to 15 dB. Assume Ricean Factor K = 6 dB.
2. Simulate the instantaneous BER expressions and plot average BERs
to verify your above system simulation results.
