Assume Rayleigh fading single path channel with
BPSK modulation where bits are derived from an equally likely Â±1 sequence and the
transmitter uses a random waveform for its privacy. Under the random waveform
technology, the transmitter changes its waveform S from one transmission to another.
Using MATLAB, plot bit error probability (BEP) or rate (BER) under both coherent
and non-coherent detection as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Your
figure should include plots from both analysis and system simulation. Use SNR
(complex) from 10 to 100 with the increment of 10.
