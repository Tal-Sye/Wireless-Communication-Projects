Assume Ricean fading single path channel with
BPSK modulation where the transmitter uses deterministic or fixed waveform
and receiver applies non-coherent detection. Under the deterministic or fixed
waveform technology, the transmitter does not change its waveform S from one transmission
to another.
1. Use MATLAB system simulation to plot BER as a function of the
Shape Parameter (or Ricean Factor) K, where K = −10,−8, . . . , 0, . . . , +8, +10
dB. Use SNR (complex) = 10 dB.
2. Evaluate the analytical BER expression and plot average BERs to
verify your above system simulation results.
3. State your conclusion with justification after comparing your above
BER curve with the BER obtained for an AWGN channel as well as that for
a Rayleigh channel when receiver applies coherent detection at SNR (complex)
= 10 dB.
